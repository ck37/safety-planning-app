## üö® Feature Overview

**Automatic Emergency Contacts** - A critical safety feature that automatically notifies designated emergency contacts when a user's crisis level reaches a critical threshold, providing an additional safety net during severe mental health emergencies.

## üìã Feature Description

This feature would automatically trigger notifications to pre-selected emergency contacts when the app's crisis detection system determines that a user is experiencing a severe crisis situation. This creates an automated safety net that doesn't rely on the user's ability to reach out during their most vulnerable moments.

### Key Capabilities:
- Automatic detection of critical crisis thresholds
- Instant notification to designated emergency contacts
- Customizable notification triggers and thresholds
- User consent and control over activation
- Integration with existing crisis detection systems

## üîß Detailed Technical Implementation Plan

### 1. Crisis Threshold Detection System
- **Integration Point**: Extend existing SmartNotificationsProvider and crisis detection logic
- **Threshold Levels**: 
  - Level 1: Mild concern (no auto-notification)
  - Level 2: Moderate distress (optional notification with user confirmation)
  - Level 3: Severe crisis (automatic notification after brief delay)
- **Detection Triggers**:
  - Mood tracking scores below critical threshold for extended period
  - User explicitly selects highest crisis level in safety plan
  - Combination of warning signs and mood indicators
  - User activates emergency mode in crisis interface

### 2. Emergency Contact Management
- **Data Structure**: Extend existing contact types in SafetyPlan.ts
- **Contact Categories**:
  - Primary emergency contact (always notified)
  - Secondary contacts (notified if primary doesn't respond)
  - Professional contacts (therapists, case managers)
  - Family/friends (optional additional layer)
- **Contact Information**: Phone, email, relationship type, availability preferences
- **Verification System**: Regular verification that contacts are still valid and willing

### 3. Notification System Architecture
- **Multi-Channel Delivery**: SMS, email, push notifications (if contacts have app)
- **Escalation Logic**: 
  - Immediate notification to primary contact
  - 15-minute delay before secondary contacts if no response
  - Professional contacts notified simultaneously for severe cases
- **Message Templates**: Pre-written, customizable emergency messages
- **Location Integration**: Optional location sharing with emergency contacts

### 4. User Control and Privacy
- **Consent Management**: Explicit opt-in with clear explanation of when notifications trigger
- **Customization Options**:
  - Adjustable threshold sensitivity
  - Notification delay settings (0-30 minutes)
  - Contact selection for different crisis levels
  - Message customization
- **Override Capabilities**: User can cancel pending notifications within grace period
- **Privacy Controls**: What information is shared with contacts

## üéØ User Stories

### Primary User Stories:
1. **As a user in crisis**, I want my emergency contacts to be automatically notified when I reach a critical state, so that I have support even when I can't ask for help myself.

2. **As a user setting up my safety plan**, I want to designate different emergency contacts for different crisis levels, so that appropriate people are notified based on the severity of my situation.

3. **As a user concerned about privacy**, I want full control over when and how my emergency contacts are notified, so that I maintain autonomy while still having safety nets.

### Secondary User Stories:
1. **As an emergency contact**, I want to receive clear, actionable information when someone I care about is in crisis, so that I can provide appropriate support.

2. **As a healthcare provider**, I want to be notified when my patients reach critical crisis levels, so that I can provide immediate professional intervention.

3. **As a user in a false alarm situation**, I want to be able to cancel pending emergency notifications, so that I don't unnecessarily worry my support network.
